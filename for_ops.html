<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>Getting started:<br>
NUDGE: Why is the chamber this particular size? What might each sound represent, and does the flavortext or an Internet search turn up any connection? What does the voice say when you start?... Are you sure?... <br>
SLEDGE: The beginning voice is not saying “Let’s play hide ‘n’ seek.” It’s saying, “Let’s play Haydn seek.”

<p>Finishing:<br>
NUDGE: The symphony nicknames should you should give you a message. How many letters total are in all the symphony nicknames? Does the flavortext give any more hints? <br>
SLEDGE: As suggested by “Do numberlink,” find orthogonal paths from each symphony’s corresponding room number to where you found it in the grid, filling in each square along the path with one letter from the symphony’s nickname. There’s only solution that completely fills the grid. There’s one sound you haven’t used yet. Can that indicate an answer? Try going in numerical order of the symphonies.
